# Invite people to projects

---

Options

- **1.** Invite them using clicking their profile picture while they are viewing your project (DOESN'T WORK ON PRIVATE PROJECTS).
- **2.** Send them an invite link, which gives them access (editing, etc). To do this, go to the editor, click on the top left where it says 'Share', and there you go, send that invite link to them. (or do this in the terminal `echo $PROJECT_INVITE_TOKEN` then append the token to [https://glitch.com/edit/#!/join/](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/join/here ))
