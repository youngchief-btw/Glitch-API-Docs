# Need to make a project private?

---

Go to the upper left corner in the editor, click the dropdown menu, and click the checkbox that says 'Make this project private', you are done!

Need to invite someone the the project so they can edit? Go [here](/docs/md/InviteToProject.md).

Privating projects is now only possible with Glitch Boosted.
